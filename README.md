<h1>Enterprise Miner data analysis and modelling for income consensus dataset</h1>

The Census Income dataset is derived from UCI dataset archieve. The challenge from this data set is to determine the binary outcome of if a person is having an annual income more 50,000 USD or less than 50,000 USD based on the 14 variables and 32562 row of dataset.
